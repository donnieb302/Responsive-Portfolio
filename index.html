    <p>I am from Dover, Delaware. I have been in the DC metro area for the past 10 years working for the U.S. Army as Contract Specialist. I served seven years on active duty with the Army and one in the Delaware Army National Guard. I have had the opportunity to live and work in various foreign countries, to include: Germany and Korea.</p>

    <p>I am an aspiring Web Developer with an interest in utilizing technology as way to assist people in their every day lives.
      I am interested in leveraging the power of technology to create or boost an internet presence for small businesses in Delaware.
      By taking this coding boot camp, I hope to gain knowledge and experience that I can take back to underserved communities in the state of Delaware.
      I am also interested in developing a small business or a startup company that provides web based service.</p>
